# ESEE READER - Automated Electric Bill Calculation üìüüì≤

- The main objective of this project, is on the view of saving electrical energy by displaying the electricity bill equivalent to the electric energy consumed in terms of watt in   the energy meter.
- This can be achieved by making simple changes in energy meter so that each and every individual can know the exact cost of the electric consumption in their home.
- By doing so, even the illiterate people can be able to know the equivalent cost of the electric energy consumed in their homes.

## Tech Stacks
- C programming.
- Arduino Programming.
- GSM Technology.
